# ElectroHub Sales Analysis – Power BI Project

## Project Overview

The ElectroHub Sales Analysis dashboard is a business intelligence project designed to simulate real-world e-commerce sales reporting. Built using Power BI, this interactive dashboard provides insights into sales performance, customer behavior, promotional effectiveness, and product profitability, enabling data-driven decision-making for stakeholders.

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow—from data preparation in Excel to data modeling, DAX measures, and dashboard design in Power BI Desktop.
